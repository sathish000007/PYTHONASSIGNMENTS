    "3. What is the most significant distinction between a dictionary and a list?\n",
    "ANS:\n",
    "    In Python, the most significant distinction between a dictionary and a list is how they store and access data:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Structure: A list is an ordered collection of items, while a dictionary is an unordered collection of key-value\n",
    "pairs. In a list, elements are accessed by their index, which represents their position in the list. In contrast, \n",
    "dictionary values are accessed by their associated unique keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Accessing Elements: In a list, elements are accessed using integer indices. For example, `my_list[0]` would \n",
    "access the first element of the list. In a dictionary, values are accessed by their keys. For example, \n",
    "`my_dict['key']` would access the value associated with the key `'key'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Mutable vs. Immutable: Lists are mutable, which means you can modify, add, or remove elements from a list.\n",
    "Dictionaries are also mutable, allowing you to modify the values associated with existing keys or add\n",
    "new key-value pairs.\n",
    "\n",
