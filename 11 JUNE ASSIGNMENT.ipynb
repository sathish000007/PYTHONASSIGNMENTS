    "1. What is a lambda function in Python, and how does it differ from a regular function?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS:\n",
    "    In Python, a lambda function is a small, anonymous function that can be defined without a name. It is also \n",
    "    known as an \"anonymous function\" because it doesn't require the use of the `def` keyword to define a function\n",
    "    name. Instead, lambda functions are created using the `lambda` keyword, followed by a list of parameters, \n",
    "    a colon (:), and an expression that is executed when the function is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the general syntax of a lambda function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "lambda arguments: expression\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Lambda functions are commonly used when you need a simple, one-line function that doesn't need to be defined \n",
    "separately. They are typically used in situations where a function is required as an argument to another function \n",
    "or when you want to create a function quickly without defining a named function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lambda functions are different from regular functions in a few ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Syntax: Lambda functions have a more concise syntax compared to regular functions. They consist of a single \n",
    "expression, whereas regular functions can have multiple statements and a return statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Namelessness: Lambda functions are anonymous, meaning they don't have a name. They are defined on the spot and \n",
    "can only be referred to through the variable they are assigned to or used directly as an argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Scope: Lambda functions are defined in their own temporary scope and don't have access to variables outside \n",
    "their scope unless explicitly passed as arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Function Objects: Lambda functions return a function object that can be assigned to a variable, passed as an\n",
    "argument, or used directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example to illustrate the usage of a lambda function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Regular function\n",
    "def square(x):\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `square()` is a regular function that takes a parameter `x` and returns the square of `x`. The\n",

    "2. Can a lambda function in Python have multiple arguments? If yes, how can you define and use\n",
    "them?\n",
    "ANS:\n",
    "    Yes, a lambda function in Python can have multiple arguments. To define a lambda function with multiple \n",
    "    arguments, you simply list the arguments separated by commas after the `lambda` keyword. The arguments are\n",
    "    followed by a colon (:), and then you specify the expression that will be executed when the lambda function \n",

    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "lambda arg1, arg2, ... : expression\n",

    "to lambda functions with any number of arguments by separating them with commas in the lambda definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's worth noting that lambda functions are typically used for simple and concise operations. If you find yourself\n",

    "3. How are lambda functions typically used in Python? Provide an example use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS:\n",
    "    Lambda functions in Python are typically used for situations where you need a small, anonymous function without \n",
    "    the need for a formal function definition. They are commonly employed in functional programming paradigms, where \n",
    "    functions are treated as first-class citizens and can be passed as arguments or returned as values.\n",
    "\n",
    "One example use case for lambda functions is in conjunction with higher-order functions like `map()`, `filter()`, and \n",
    "`reduce()`. These functions often expect a function as an argument to perform some operation on elements of a \n",
    "sequence. Using lambda functions, you can define the required functionality concisely without the need for a \n",
    "separate function definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example to demonstrate the use of lambda functions with `map()`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "\n",
    "squared_numbers = list(map(lambda x: x ** 2, numbers))\n",
    "print(squared_numbers)  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the lambda function `lambda x: x ** 2` is passed as an argument to `map()`. The lambda function \n",

    "4. What are the advantages and limitations of lambda functions compared to regular functions in\n",
    "Python?\n",
    "ANS:\n",
    "    Lambda functions, also known as anonymous functions, are a concise way of defining small, one-line functions\n",
    "    in Python. While they offer some advantages over regular functions, they also come with limitations. Here are \n",
    "    the advantages and limitations of lambda functions compared to regular functions in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of Lambda Functions:\n",
    "1. Concise syntax: Lambda functions are defined in a compact syntax, allowing you to define simple functions in a \n",
    "single line of code. This can make your code more readable and reduce the need for defining separate functions for\n",
    "small tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. No need for a return statement: Lambda functions automatically return the result of the expression they evaluate.\n",
    "You don't need to explicitly use a `return` statement as you would in a regular function. This simplifies the code \n",
    "and makes it more concise.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Functional programming: Lambda functions are often used in conjunction with higher-order functions like `map()`,\n",
    "`filter()`, and `reduce()`. They enable a functional programming style by allowing you to pass functions as \n",
    "arguments to other functions. This can lead to more expressive and flexible code.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Local function definition: Lambda functions are defined locally within the scope where they are used. This means \n",
    "you can define them directly at the point of use, avoiding the need for a separate function definition elsewhere in\n",
    "your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Limitations of Lambda Functions:\n",
    "1. Limited functionality: Lambda functions are designed for simple, one-line expressions. They cannot contain\n",
    "multiple statements, assignments, or complex control flow. If you need more complex logic or multiple statements, \n",
    "a regular function is more appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Lack of name: Lambda functions are anonymous, meaning they don't have a name associated with them. This can \n",
    "make them harder to debug and trace when an error occurs, as they don't have a meaningful identifier to refer to.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Limited readability: While lambda functions can make code more concise, they can also reduce readability, \n",
    "especially if the expression becomes too complex or if the lambda function is used in multiple places. In such \n",
    "cases, a regular function with a descriptive name might be more readable and maintainable.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Reduced reusability: Lambda functions are best suited for short-lived, throwaway functions that are not intended\n",
    "to be reused. Since they lack a name and are defined locally, it can be challenging to reuse them in different \n",
    "parts of your codebase. Regular functions, on the other hand, can be defined globally and can be reused across \n",
    "different modules or scripts.\n",

    "    Yes, lambda functions in Python can access variables defined outside of their own scope. This is because lambda \n",

    "result = lambda_func(5)\n",
    "print(result)  # Output: 15\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we have a function called `outer_function` that defines a variable `x` and returns a lambda \n",
    "function. The lambda function takes an argument `y` and adds it to the variable `x` from the outer scope. \n",
    "\n",
    "When `outer_function` is called, it returns the lambda function, which is assigned to the variable `lambda_func`.\n",
    "Later, we invoke `lambda_func` with an argument of `5`, resulting in `x + y` where `x` is `10` and `y` is `5`. \n",
    "Therefore, the output is `15`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lambda function has access to the variable `x` even after `outer_function` has completed execution because \n",
