    "1. Explain what inheritance is in object-oriented programming and why it is used.\n",
    "ANS:\n",
    "    In object-oriented programming (OOP), inheritance is a fundamental concept that allows a class (referred to as \n",
    "    the \"subclass\" or \"derived class\") to inherit properties and behaviors from another class (known as the \n",
    "    \"superclass\" or \"base class\"). In simpler terms, inheritance enables one class to acquire the attributes and \n",
    "    methods of another class, forming a hierarchical relationship between classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main purpose of inheritance is to promote code reusability and to establish a hierarchical structure among \n",
    "classes. Here's why inheritance is used:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Code Reusability:** By inheriting from a base class, a subclass can reuse the code already defined in the base \n",
    "class. This avoids the need to duplicate code and leads to more maintainable and modular programs. When changes are \n",
    "made to the base class, all its subclasses automatically benefit from those changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Extensibility:** Inheritance allows developers to extend the functionality of existing classes. They can create\n",
    "new classes that inherit from a base class and then add specific attributes or behaviors to meet new requirements. \n",
    "This process is known as \"subclassing\" or \"deriving.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Abstraction:** Inheritance helps in creating abstract classes that provide a blueprint for other classes to \n",
    "follow. An abstract class can define a set of methods or attributes that must be implemented by its subclasses. \n",
    "These abstract classes can serve as a way to define common characteristics for a group of related classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Polymorphism:** Inheritance is closely related to polymorphism, which allows objects of different classes to\n",
    "be treated as objects of a common base class. This facilitates writing more flexible and generic code, as different \n",
    "subclasses can be used interchangeably through their common base class interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate this with a simple example, let's consider a class hierarchy for different types of vehicles:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Vehicle:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, make, model):\n",
    "        self.make = make\n",
    "        self.model = model\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def drive(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Vehicle is in motion.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Car(Vehicle):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, make, model, num_doors):\n",
    "        super().__init__(make, model)\n",
    "        self.num_doors = num_doors\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def drive(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Car is moving forward.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Motorcycle(Vehicle):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, make, model, num_wheels):\n",
    "        super().__init__(make, model)\n",
    "        self.num_wheels = num_wheels\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def drive(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Motorcycle is on the go.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `Car` and `Motorcycle` classes inherit from the `Vehicle` class. They gain access to the `make`\n",
    "and `model` attributes, as well as the `drive()` method. However, they can override the `drive()` method with their \n",
    "specific implementations.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using inheritance, we achieve code reusability, abstraction, and polymorphism. We can create instances of `Car` \n",
    "and `Motorcycle` objects and treat them as instances of `Vehicle`, allowing for more flexible and generalized \n",
    "coding practices."

    "2. Discuss the concept of single inheritance and multiple inheritance, highlighting their\n",
    "differences and advantages.\n",
    "ANS:\n",
    "    In object-oriented programming, single inheritance and multiple inheritance are two different approaches to class \n",
    "    inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Single Inheritance:**\n",
    "Single inheritance refers to the concept of a class inheriting from only one base class. In other words, a subclass can\n",
    "have only one direct superclass. When a subclass inherits from a single base class, it acquires all the attributes \n",
    "and behaviors of that base class. Single inheritance creates a simple and linear class hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of Single Inheritance:\n",
    "- Simplicity: Single inheritance is straightforward to understand and manage. The class hierarchy remains linear, \n",
    "making it easier to track and troubleshoot code.\n",
    "- Reduced Complexity: As there's only one direct superclass, the potential for conflicts or ambiguity in method \n",
    "resolution is minimized.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of Single Inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Animal speaks.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Dog barks.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the `Dog` class inherits from the `Animal` class, demonstrating single inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Multiple Inheritance:**\n",
    "Multiple inheritance allows a class to inherit from more than one base class. This means a subclass can have \n",
    "multiple direct superclasses. When a class inherits from multiple base classes, it inherits all their attributes \n",
    "and behaviors. This can lead to complex class hierarchies, especially when there are conflicts or ambiguities \n",
    "between the methods or attributes of the base classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of Multiple Inheritance:\n",
    "- Code Reusability: Multiple inheritance promotes greater code reusability, as a class can combine features from \n",
    "multiple sources.\n",
    "- Enhanced Flexibility: By inheriting from multiple classes, a subclass can combine functionalities from various \n",
    "sources, creating more versatile and specialized objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of Multiple Inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Flyable:\n",
    "    def fly(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Can fly.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Swimmable:\n",
    "    def swim(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Can swim.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class FlyingFish(Flyable, Swimmable):\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "fish = FlyingFish()\n",
    "fish.fly()\n",
    "fish.swim()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `FlyingFish` class inherits from both the `Flyable` and `Swimmable` classes, showcasing \n",
    "multiple inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Differences between Single Inheritance and Multiple Inheritance:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Number of Base Classes:**\n",
    "   - Single Inheritance: One subclass inherits from only one base class.\n",
    "   - Multiple Inheritance: One subclass inherits from multiple base classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Class Hierarchy:**\n",
    "   - Single Inheritance: Results in a linear and simpler class hierarchy.\n",
    "   - Multiple Inheritance: Can lead to complex class hierarchies with diamond-shaped patterns (if multiple base \n",
    "     classes inherit from a common base class).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Choosing Between Single and Multiple Inheritance:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice between single and multiple inheritance depends on the specific requirements of the project. Single \n",
    "inheritance is generally easier to manage and avoids complexities associated with multiple inheritance, making it a \n",
    "safer choice for simpler scenarios. On the other hand, multiple inheritance is useful when there's a clear need to \n",
    "combine functionalities from different sources, promoting code reusability and flexibility. However, developers \n",
    "must be cautious to avoid potential conflicts or the \"diamond problem\" that can arise in complex multiple \n",

    "3. Explain the terms \"base class\" and \"derived class\" in the context of inheritance.\n",
    "ANS:\n",
    "    In the context of inheritance in object-oriented programming (OOP), \"base class\" and \"derived class\" are two \n",
    "    important terms that describe the relationship between classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Base Class:**\n",
    "A base class, also known as a parent class or superclass, is a class from which other classes inherit attributes and\n",
    "behaviors. It serves as a template or blueprint for creating more specialized classes. The base class contains \n",
    "common characteristics and functionalities that are shared among its derived classes. It is the class that is being \n",
    "extended or subclassed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance allows the base class to pass on its attributes and methods to its derived classes, enabling code reuse \n",
    "and creating a hierarchical relationship among classes. A base class can have multiple derived classes, each of which \n",
    "extends or modifies the features inherited from the base class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of a base class:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Shape:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, color):\n",
    "        self.color = color\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def draw(self):\n",
    "        print(f\"Drawing a shape with color {self.color}.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `Shape` is the base class that defines attributes like `color` and a method called `draw()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Derived Class:**\n",
    "A derived class, also known as a child class or subclass, is a class that inherits attributes and behaviors from a \n",
    "base class. It is created by extending or subclassing the base class. A derived class can add new attributes, \n",
    "methods, or override existing methods inherited from the base class.\n",
    "\n",
    "The derived class inherits all the attributes and methods of the base class and can also have additional attributes \n",
    "and methods specific to itself. It represents a more specialized or specific version of the base class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of a derived class:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Circle(Shape):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, color, radius):\n",
    "        super().__init__(color)\n",
    "        self.radius = radius\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def draw(self):\n",
    "        print(f\"Drawing a circle with color {self.color} and radius {self.radius}.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `Circle` is a derived class that inherits from the `Shape` base class. It extends the `Shape` class\n",
    "by adding a new attribute `radius` and overrides the `draw()` method to provide its own implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The relationship between a base class and a derived class is often represented as an \"is-a\" relationship. In the \n",
    "example above, we can say that a \"Circle is-a Shape,\" indicating that a `Circle` object is a specialized version of \n",
    "the more general `Shape` object."

    "4. What is the significance of the \"protected\" access modifier in inheritance? How does\n",
    "it differ from \"private\" and \"public\" modifiers?\n",
    "ANS:\n",
    "    In object-oriented programming (OOP), access modifiers define the visibility and accessibility of class members \n",
    "    (attributes and methods) within the class and its subclasses. The three main access modifiers are \"private,\" \n",
    "    \"protected,\" and \"public.\" Each modifier has a different level of visibility, which affects how members can be \n",
    "    accessed and inherited in the context of inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Private Access Modifier:**\n",
    "- Members marked as private can only be accessed within the class in which they are defined.\n",
    "- Private members are not directly accessible from outside the class or its subclasses.\n",
    "- Subclasses cannot inherit or access private members of the base class.\n",

    "- Members marked as protected are intended to be accessible within the class and its subclasses.\n",
    "- In Python, there's a convention for protected members: any identifier starting with a single underscore is considered \n",

    "        self._protected_method()  # Calling the protected method\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Public Access Modifier:**\n",
    "- Members marked as public are accessible from anywhere, including outside the class and its subclasses.\n",
    "- By default, all members in Python are considered public unless specified otherwise with private or protected \n",
    "  identifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",

    "        self.public_method()  # Calling the public method\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Significance in Inheritance:**\n",
    "- Private members are not inherited by subclasses. They remain exclusive to the class in which they are defined.\n",
