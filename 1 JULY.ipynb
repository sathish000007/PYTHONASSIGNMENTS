    "    \n",
    "    The primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is to model real-world entities and their interactions in \n",
    "    a software application. OOP is a programming paradigm that organizes code into objects, which are instances of \n",
    "    classes representing specific entities or concepts. Each object encapsulates data (attributes) and behaviors\n",
    "    (methods) related to the entity it represents.\n",
    "\n",
    "The four main principles of OOP are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Encapsulation: This involves bundling the data and methods that operate on the data within a single unit \n",
    "(i.e., the object). It allows data hiding, meaning the internal workings of an object can be hidden from the \n",
    "outside, and interactions with the object are controlled through well-defined interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Abstraction: Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex reality by representing only relevant \n",
    "characteristics of an object while hiding unnecessary details. It enables programmers to focus on the essential \n",
    "aspects of an object and ignore irrelevant complexities.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Inheritance: Inheritance allows objects (or classes) to inherit properties and behaviors from other objects \n",
    "(or classes). This promotes code reuse and hierarchy, where more specialized classes can inherit from more general \n",
    "classes, forming an \"is-a\" relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class or as instances of \n",
    "their specific child class, depending on the context. This feature enables flexible and generic programming, as \n",
    "different objects can be used interchangeably as long as they adhere to a common interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these principles, OOP aims to enhance code reusability, maintainability, and scalability, making it \n",
    "easier to design and develop complex software systems."

    "2. What is an object in Python?\n",
    "ANS:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    In Python, an object is a fundamental concept and the building block of all data structures and code in the \n",
    "    language. In simple terms, an object is a self-contained unit that consists of both data (attributes) and \n",
    "    functions (methods) that operate on the data. Every value in Python is an object, including simple data types \n",
    "    like numbers and strings, as well as more complex data structures and user-defined classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some key characteristics of objects in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Identity: Each object in Python has a unique identity, which can be thought of as a memory address. You can get \n",
    "the identity of an object using the built-in `id()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Data: Objects have attributes that store data associated with the object. These attributes can be accessed using \n",
    "the dot notation, like `object_name.attribute`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Methods: Objects can also have methods, which are functions that operate on the object's data or perform specific\n",
    "actions related to the object. Methods are invoked using the dot notation as well, like `object_name.method()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Type: Every object in Python belongs to a specific data type (also known as a class). The type of an object\n",
    "determines what operations can be performed on it and what behavior it exhibits.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Creation: Objects are created based on their class definition. A class is like a blueprint that defines the \n",
    "structure and behavior of objects of that type. When you create an object, you are instantiating a class, and the \n",
    "object becomes an instance of that class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simple example of creating an object in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Define a class\n",
    "class Dog:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "\n",
    "    def bark(self):\n",
    "        return \"Woof!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create an object (instance) of the class\n",
    "dog1 = Dog(\"Buddy\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Access object attributes\n",
    "print(dog1.name)  # Output: Buddy\n",
    "\n",
    "# Call object methods\n",
    "print(dog1.bark())  # Output: Woof!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `dog1` is an object of the `Dog` class. It has an attribute `name` and a method `bark()`, which \n",
    "can be accessed and used through the object."

    "    In Python, a class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines a new data type that encapsulates data \n",

    "within it. Attributes are variables that store data associated with each object, and methods are functions that \n",
    "operate on that data or perform specific actions related to the objects of the class.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "    def honk(self):\n",
    "        return \"Beep! Beep!\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we've defined a class called `Car`, which has attributes `make`, `model`, and `year`. It also has \n",
    "three methods: `start()`, `stop()`, and `honk()`. The `__init__()` method is a special method known as the \n",

    "# Create objects of the Car class\n",
    "car1 = Car(\"Toyota\", \"Camry\", 2022)\n",
    "car2 = Car(\"Honda\", \"Accord\", 2023)\n",

    "4. What are attributes and methods in a class?\n",
    "ANS:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    In a class, attributes and methods are the two main components that define the characteristics and behaviors of \n",
    "    objects created from that class. They are the building blocks that enable the class to encapsulate data and \n",
    "    functionality. Let's take a closer look at each of them:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Attributes:\n",
    "   Attributes are variables that hold data associated with each instance (object) of the class. They represent the \n",
    "state or characteristics of the objects. In Python, attributes are defined within the class and are accessed using \n",
    "the dot notation on the instances of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "   There are two types of attributes in a class:\n",
    "   - Instance Attributes: These attributes are specific to each instance of the class. They are defined inside the \n",
    "class's methods, typically within the special method called `__init__()`, which is the constructor. Instance \n",
    "attributes are initialized when an object is created from the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Class Attributes: These attributes are shared among all instances of the class. They are defined directly \n",
    "    within the class but outside of any methods. Class attributes are common to all objects of the class and do\n",
    "    not change across instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Here's an example of a class with both instance and class attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Dog:\n",
    "    species = \"Canine\"  # Class attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "        self.name = name  # Instance attribute\n",
    "        self.age = age    # Instance attribute\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Methods:\n",
    "   Methods are functions defined within a class that operate on the attributes of the class. They represent the \n",
    "actions or behaviors that objects of the class can perform. Methods can access and modify the attributes of the \n",
    "class and are used to implement the functionality of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "   There are three types of methods in a class:\n",
    "   - Instance Methods: These methods take the instance (self) as their first parameter and operate on the attributes\n",
    "specific to that instance. They can access and modify the instance attributes and perform actions based on the \n",
    "state of the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Class Methods: These methods take the class (cls) as their first parameter and can access and modify \n",
    "    class-level attributes. They are defined using the `@classmethod` decorator.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Static Methods: These methods do not require access to the instance or class and do not modify attributes. \n",
    "    They are defined using the `@staticmethod` decorator.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Here's an example of a class with instance and class methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Circle:\n",
    "    pi = 3.14159  # Class attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __init__(self, radius):\n",
    "        self.radius = radius  # Instance attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "    def area(self):\n",
    "        return self.pi * self.radius ** 2  # Instance method\n",
    "\n",
    "    @classmethod\n",
    "    def set_pi(cls, new_pi):\n",
    "        cls.pi = new_pi  # Class method\n",

    "    def circumference(radius):\n",
    "        return 2 * Circle.pi * radius  # Static method\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, attributes represent the data associated with objects, while methods define the behaviors and actions \n",
    "those objects can perform. Together, they form the core of a class and allow us to model complex entities and \n",
    "implement their functionality in a structured and organized manner."

    "     across instances.\n",
    "   - You can access class variables using the class name or any instance of the class.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Instance Variables:\n",
    "   - Instance variables are attributes that belong to individual instances of a class. They are defined within the \n",
    "class's methods, typically within the special method called `__init__()` (the constructor).\n",
    "   - Each instance of the class has its own set of instance variables. These variables store unique data for each \n",
    "    object created from the class.\n",
    "   - Instance variables represent the state or characteristics of individual objects, and they can vary across \n",
    "different instances.\n",
    "   - You can access instance variables using the dot notation on the instances of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of instance variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Circle:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, radius):\n",
    "        self.radius = radius  # Instance variable\n",

    "    def area(self):\n",
    "        return 3.14159 * self.radius ** 2  # Instance method using the instance variable\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "6. What is the purpose of the self parameter in Python class methods?\n",

    "    being called. It acts as a placeholder that allows the method to access and modify the attributes \n",
    "    (instance variables) of the specific object the method is being invoked on.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you define a method inside a class, you need to include `self` as the first parameter in the method's \n",

    "Python automatically handles it by passing the instance (the object itself) as the `self` parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "The naming of the `self` parameter is a convention, and you could technically choose a different name for it, but \n",
    "it is strongly recommended to stick to the convention to maintain code readability and consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example to illustrate the purpose of the `self` parameter:\n",

    "```python\n",
    "class Person:\n",

    "# Calling the method on the object\n",
    "print(person1.introduce())  # Output: Hi, my name is Alice and I am 30 years old.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this example, the `introduce()` method uses the `self` parameter to access the `name` and `age` attributes of \n",

    "that are unique to the object and incorporate them into the returned string.\n",
