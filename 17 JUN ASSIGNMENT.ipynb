    "1. What is the role of try and exception block?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS:\n",
    "    The \"try\" and \"exception\" (often referred to as \"catch\" in other programming languages) blocks are part of error\n",
    "    handling mechanisms in programming languages. They are used to manage and handle potential exceptions or errors \n",
    "    that may occur during the execution of a program. The basic purpose of these blocks is to prevent the program \n",
    "    from terminating abruptly when an error occurs and instead allow the program to gracefully handle the error and \n",
    "    continue its execution or take appropriate actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how the \"try\" and \"exception\" blocks work together:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. \"Try\" block: The code that might potentially raise an exception or error is placed within the \"try\" block. The \n",
    "try block essentially encloses the code that is expected to run without any errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. \"Exception\" block: The \"exception\" block (or \"catch\" block) follows the \"try\" block and specifies what should \n",
    "happen when an exception or error occurs within the \"try\" block. The exception block contains code that handles the\n",
    "error or exception, such as displaying an error message, logging the error, or taking specific actions to recover\n",
    "from the error.\n",
    "\n",
    "When an exception or error occurs in the \"try\" block, the program flow is transferred immediately to the \n",
    "corresponding \"exception\" block, bypassing the rest of the code in the \"try\" block. This helps in isolating the \n",
    "error and allows the program to continue executing the remaining parts of the code after the \"exception\" block.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simple example in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    numerator = 10\n",
    "    denominator = 0\n",
    "    result = numerator / denominator\n",
    "    print(\"Result:\", result)\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "    print(\"Error: Cannot divide by zero.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, a division by zero error occurs inside the \"try\" block. Instead of crashing the program, the \n",
    "control is transferred to the \"except\" block, which catches the ZeroDivisionError and prints an appropriate error \n",
    "message.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using try-except blocks, programmers can improve the robustness of their code and handle potential issues in a \n",
    "controlled manner. They allow developers to gracefully respond to errors, making programs more reliable and \n",
    "user-friendly."

    "2. What is the syntax for a basic try-except block?\n",
    "ANS:\n",
    "    The basic syntax for a try-except block in most programming languages, including Python, is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    # Code that might raise an exception or error\n",
    "    # ...\n",
    "    # ...\n",
    "except SomeExceptionType:\n",
    "    # Code to handle the exception\n",
    "    # ...\n",
    "    # ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a breakdown of the syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `try:`: The keyword \"try\" starts the try block. This is where you place the code that might raise an exception \n",
    "or error.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `except SomeExceptionType:`: The \"except\" keyword is used to define the exception block (also known as the catch\n",
    "    block in other languages). `SomeExceptionType` is the specific type of exception that you want to catch. \n",
    "    This is optional, and you can catch a more general `Exception` if you want to handle any type of exception. \n",
    "    If an exception of the specified type (or a subclass of it) occurs in the try block, the control will transfer \n",
    "    to this except block.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `# Code to handle the exception`: Inside the \"except\" block, you include the code that will be executed if an \n",
    "exception of the specified type occurs in the \"try\" block. Here, you can handle the exception, display an error \n",
    "message, log the error, or take appropriate actions to recover from the error.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can have multiple \"except\" blocks to handle different types of exceptions, or you can have a single \"except\" \n",
    "block to handle multiple types of exceptions. You can also have an optional `else` block that will be executed if\n",
    "no exception occurs in the \"try\" block, and a `finally` block that will be executed regardless of whether an \n",
    "exception occurred or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example in Python catching multiple types of exceptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    numerator = 10\n",
    "    denominator = 0\n",
    "    result = numerator / denominator\n",
    "    print(\"Result:\", result)\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "    print(\"Error: Cannot divide by zero.\")\n",
    "except TypeError:\n",
    "    print(\"Error: Incorrect data types.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, if a ZeroDivisionError occurs, the first \"except\" block will handle it, and if a TypeError occurs,\n",
    "the second \"except\" block will handle it."

    "    If an exception occurs inside a try block, and there is no matching except block to handle that specific type \n",

    "\n",
    "1. Bare except block:\n",
    "A bare except block catches any type of exception that occurs within the try block. It doesn't specify a particular \n",
    "exception type, making it a general catch-all block for all exceptions. While using a bare except block can prevent \n",
    "the program from terminating abruptly due to unhandled exceptions, it is generally not recommended. Catching all \n",
    "exceptions without distinguishing their types can make it difficult to identify the specific errors that occur, \n",
    "leading to potential bugs and reduced code maintainability. Bare except blocks can hide unexpected issues and make \n",
    "debugging more challenging.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of a bare except block in Python:\n",

    "try:\n",
    "    # Some code that might raise exceptions\n",
    "except:\n",
    "    # Code to handle any type of exception\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Specific exception type:\n",
    "A specific exception type, on the other hand, catches only the specified type of exception or its subclasses. By \n",
    "providing a specific exception type in the except block, you are explicitly handling a known type of exception \n",
    "while letting other exceptions propagate up the call stack. This approach allows you to handle different types of \n",

    "b. FloatingPointError:\n",

    "\n",
    "e. OverflowError:\n",
    "Reason: OverflowError is raised when an arithmetic operation exceeds the maximum representable value for a numeric \n",
