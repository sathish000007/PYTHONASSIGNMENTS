    "elements where each element can be accessed by its index.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Indexing: Both lists and strings support indexing, allowing you to access individual elements by their position\n",
    "within the sequence. Indexing starts from 0, where the first element is at index 0, the second element is at \n",
    "index 1, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Slicing: Lists and strings both support slicing, which allows you to extract a portion of the sequence by \n",

    "\n",
    "4. Iteration: Lists and strings can be iterated over using loops or other iteration mechanisms in Python.\n",
    "You can iterate over the elements of a list or the characters of a string one by one.\n",
    "\n",

    "13. What&#39;s the difference between tuples and lists?\n",
    "ANS:\n",
    "    Tuples and lists are both used to store collections of items in Python, but they have some key differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Mutability: Lists are mutable, which means you can modify their elements after they are created.\n",
    "You can add, remove, or change elements in a list. On the other hand, tuples are immutable, which means they \n",
    "cannot be modified once created. Once a tuple is defined, its elements cannot be added, removed, or changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Syntax: Lists are represented by square brackets `[]`, while tuples are represented by parentheses `()`.\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "   my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Usage: Lists are commonly used when you have a collection of items that may change or require modification. \n",
    "They provide flexibility with their mutable nature. Tuples, on the other hand, are often used when you have a \n",
    "collection of items that should not change, such as coordinates or data that represents a single entity. Tuples \n",
    "provide immutability, which can be useful in scenarios where you want to ensure that the values remain unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Performance: Tuples are generally more memory-efficient and faster to process than lists. Since tuples are\n",
    "immutable, Python can optimize memory allocation and perform certain operations more efficiently. Lists, being \n",
    "mutable, require more memory allocation and have additional overhead for handling modifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Method Availability: Lists have a wider range of built-in methods compared to tuples. The reason is that \n",
    "tuples are immutable, so methods that modify the tuple are not available. However, both lists and tuples support \n",
    "common operations such as indexing, slicing, and iteration.\n",
    "\n",

    "17. How do you distinguish between copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy()?\n",
    "ANS:\n",
    "    The `copy.copy()` and `copy.deepcopy()` functions are part of the `copy` module in Python, and they are used \n",
    "    to create copies of objects. However, they differ in terms of how they handle nested objects and their \n",
    "    mutability.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `copy.copy()`: The `copy.copy()` function performs a shallow copy of an object. It creates a new object that \n",
    "is a copy of the original object, but it does not recursively copy nested objects. Instead, it creates references \n",
    "to the nested objects. Changes made to the nested objects in the copy will also be reflected in the original object, \n",
    "as they refer to the same objects in memory. Shallow copying is suitable for non-mutable objects or cases where \n",
    "you want to create a new object that shares some of its data with the original object.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `copy.deepcopy()`: The `copy.deepcopy()` function performs a deep copy of an object. It creates a completely\n",
    "independent copy of the original object and all its nested objects recursively. It recursively copies all objects\n",
    "contained within the original object, ensuring that any modifications made to the copied objects do not affect the \n",
    "original or other copies. Deep copying is useful when you need to create a new object with its own independent \n",
