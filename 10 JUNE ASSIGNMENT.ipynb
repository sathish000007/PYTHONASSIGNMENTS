    "\n",
    "ANS:\n",
    "    In Python, a built-in function is a function that is provided by the Python programming language itself. \n",
    "    These functions are pre-defined and readily available for use without requiring any additional code or module \n",
    "    import. On the other hand, a user-defined function is a function created by the user to perform a specific task \n",
    "    or set of operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of a built-in function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example of a built-in function\n",
    "length = len(\"Hello, World!\")\n",
    "print(length)  # Output: 13\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `len()` function is a built-in function that returns the length of a string. It does not \n",
    "require any additional code or module import and can be used directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's see an example of a user-defined function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example of a user-defined function\n",
    "def greet(name):\n",

    "\n",
    "greet(\"Alice\")  # Output: Hello, Alice!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we define a user-defined function called `greet()` that takes a parameter `name` and prints a\n",
    "greeting message with the provided name.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the main difference between a built-in function and a user-defined function is that built-in functions\n",

    "\n",
    "ANS:\n",
    "    In Python, you can pass arguments to a function in two ways: positional arguments and keyword arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Positional Arguments:\n",
    "Positional arguments are passed to a function based on their position or order. The arguments are matched to the \n",
    "parameters in the function definition based on their respective positions. The order in which you pass the \n",
    "arguments matters, as they are assigned to the corresponding parameters in the same order.\n",

    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def greet(name, message):\n",
    "    print(f\"Hello {name}, {message}!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Calling the function with positional arguments\n",
    "greet(\"Alice\", \"how are you?\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the first argument \"Alice\" is assigned to the `name` parameter, and the second argument \"how are \n",
    "you?\" is assigned to the `message` parameter. The output will be: \"Hello Alice, how are you?\".\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Keyword Arguments:\n",
    "Keyword arguments are passed to a function with a specific keyword or parameter name. Instead of relying on their \n",
    "positions, you explicitly mention the parameter name and its corresponding value. This way, the order of the \n",
    "arguments doesn't matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of a function that takes keyword arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def greet(name, message):\n",
    "    print(f\"Hello {name}, {message}!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Calling the function with keyword arguments\n",
    "greet(message=\"how are you?\", name=\"Bob\")\n",

    "\n",
    "In this example, the arguments are explicitly passed with their parameter names. The output will be the same as \n",
    "before: \"Hello Bob, how are you?\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Keyword arguments provide more flexibility, especially when a function has a large number of parameters. They allow\n",
    "you to pass values selectively to specific parameters without relying on their position.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's worth noting that you can mix positional and keyword arguments, but positional arguments must come before \n",
    "keyword arguments. Once you start passing arguments using keywords, all subsequent arguments must be passed the \n",
    "same way."

    "statements? Explain with an example.\n",
    "ANS:\n",
    "    The purpose of the return statement in a function is to specify the value that the function should output or \n",
    "\"return\" when it is called. It allows a function to compute a result and pass it back to the caller.\n",
    "\n",
    "A function can indeed have multiple return statements. However, as soon as a return statement is executed, the \n",
    "function terminates, and the value specified in the return statement is immediately sent back to the caller. \n",
    "This means that any code after a return statement will not be executed.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def divide(a, b):\n",
    "    if b == 0:\n",
    "        return \"Error: Division by zero is not allowed.\"\n",

    "    result = a / b\n",
    "    return result\n",
    "\n",
    "# Calling the function with different arguments\n",
    "print(divide(10, 2))   # Output: 5.0\n",
    "print(divide(10, 0))   # Output: Error: Division by zero is not allowed.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `divide()` function takes two arguments, `a` and `b`, and performs division. It first checks \n",
    "if `b` is zero. If it is, it immediately returns an error message using a return statement. Otherwise, it computes \n",
    "the result of the division and returns it.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we call `divide(10, 2)`, the function executes the division and returns the result, which is 5.0. However, \n",
    "when we call `divide(10, 0)`, the function encounters the `if` condition, detects that `b` is zero, and returns \n",
    "the error message. The code execution stops at that point, and the error message is printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the return statement allows a function to provide an output value to the caller, and a function can have \n",

    "    require a defined name using the `def` keyword. They are typically used for simple and concise operations.\n",
    "    Lambda functions are created using the `lambda` keyword followed by the arguments and a single expression.\n",

    "lambda arguments: expression\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Lambda functions are different from regular functions in a few ways:\n",

    "\n",
    "2. Single Expression: Lambda functions are limited to a single expression rather than a block of statements. This\n",
    "is why they are usually used for concise operations that can be expressed in one line.\n",
    "\n",

    "print(square_lambda(5))     # Output: 25\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the regular function `square(x)` squares the input `x` using the `**` operator and returns the \n",
    "result. The lambda function `square_lambda` accomplishes the same task in a single line using the lambda syntax. \n",
    "Both functions output the same result when called with the argument `5`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lambda functions are particularly useful in situations where you need a simple function for a short-lived \n",
    "operation or as an argument to higher-order functions like `map()`, `filter()`, or `reduce()`. These functions\n",

    "\n",
    "ANS:\n",
    "    The concept of \"scope\" in Python defines the visibility and accessibility of variables and objects in different parts of a program.

    "\n",
    "In Python, there are two main scopes related to functions: local scope and global scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Local Scope:\n",
    "Local scope refers to the scope within a function. Variables defined inside a function are considered to have a local scope and are only accessible within that function. Local variables are created when the function is called and are destroyed when the function execution is completed.\n",

    "within the function `my_function()`. Any changes made to the global variable inside the function will affect its \n",
    "value globally.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if you want to modify a global variable from within a function, you need to use the `global` keyword to\n",
    "explicitly indicate that you're referring to the global variable, rather than creating a new local variable with \n",
    "the same name.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 10   # Global variable\n",
    "\n",

    "print(x)    # Output: 20\n",

    "In this example, the `global` keyword is used to indicate that the variable `x` inside `my_function()` refers to \n",
    "the global variable, not a new local variable. The modification made to `x` inside the function affects its value \n",
    "globally.\n",
    "\n",

    "print(result[1])  # Output: 20\n",
    "print(result[2])  # Output: 30\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Returning as a Dictionary:\n",
    "If you want to associate the returned values with specific keys, you can return them as a dictionary. The caller \n",
    "can then access the values using the corresponding keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def get_values():\n",
    "    a = 10\n",
    "    b = 20\n",
    "    c = 30\n",

    "print(result['value2'])  # Output: 20\n",
    "print(result['value3'])  # Output: 30\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "By using the return statement to return multiple values, you can conveniently package and transmit several \n",
    "pieces of data from a function to the caller. The caller can then handle the returned values according to the \n",

    "7. What is the difference between the \"pass by value\" and \"pass by reference\" concepts when it\n",
    "comes to function arguments in Python?\n",
    "ANS:\n",
    "    In Python, the concepts of \"pass by value\" and \"pass by reference\" relate to how arguments are passed to functions. However, Python uses a slightly different approach called \"pass by assignment.\" Let's understand these concepts and the differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Pass by Value:\n",
    "In pass by value, a copy of the value of the variable is passed to the function. Any modifications made to the parameter within the function do not affect the original variable outside the function. This means that the function works with a local copy of the value.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Pass by Reference:\n",
    "In pass by reference, instead of the value, a reference to the memory location of the variable is passed to the \n",
    "function. Consequently, modifications made to the parameter within the function directly affect the original \n",
    "variable outside the function. Both the function and the caller are working with the same memory location.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, neither pure pass by value nor pass by reference is used. Instead, it employs a mechanism called \n",
    "\"pass by assignment\" or \"call by object reference.\" It works as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- When an immutable object (e.g., a number, string, or tuple) is passed as an argument, a copy of the object's \n",
    "reference is created and passed to the function. The function receives a new reference to the same object. \n",
    "However, since immutable objects cannot be modified, the effect is similar to pass by value.\n",
    "\n",
    "- When a mutable object (e.g., a list, dictionary, or user-defined object) is passed as an argument, a copy of the \n",
    "object's reference is created and passed to the function. The function receives a new reference to the same object.\n",
    "If the function modifies the mutable object, the changes are reflected in the original object outside the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example to illustrate the behavior in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def modify_list(lst, num):\n",
    "    lst.append(num)\n",
    "    num = 100\n",
    "\n",
    "my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "my_num = 10\n",
    "\n",
    "modify_list(my_list, my_num)\n",
    "print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 10]\n",
    "print(my_num)   # Output: 10\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `my_list` is a mutable list, and `my_num` is an immutable integer. When the function \n",
    "`modify_list()` is called, a copy of the references to `my_list` and `my_num` is passed. The function modifies \n",
    "the list by appending `num` to it, which affects the original list outside the function. However, the modification \n",
    "to `num` within the function does not affect the original variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize, Python uses a form of \"pass by assignment\" where references are passed as values. Immutable objects \n",
    "behave similarly to \"pass by value,\" while mutable objects exhibit behavior closer to \"pass by reference\" due to \n",
    "the shared memory reference."
